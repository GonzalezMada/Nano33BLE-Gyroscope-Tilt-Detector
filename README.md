# Nano33BLE-Gyroscope-Tilt-Detector
This project focuses on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2's 3-axis gyroscope sensor of the IMU system. The goal is to measures the tilt direction of the board. The Arduino IDE Serial Monitor will be used to print the return results after using the gyroscope's axis values to accomplish this.
